# Loops of the game

The 3 loops are:
- `town` - investment loop
- `character` - upgrade loop
- `dungeon` - idle combat loop 

_note_ - keep the ideas in the same "verticals" as these 3 loops, or add a fourth one. Do not interfere with the current cycle.

Every loop should be looked at (not set in stone) as a vertical of its own

## 01 - Town loop

_Core purpose_ - main influx & investing, obtaining tokens

_Caveat_ - tokens might originate from the outside, will influence economy

The core concept of towns is quite interesting, so this area might change, and change it will later down the road. We want full flexibility here. Main idea was to buy the slots to trade, and buy energy. 

The things that might change: 
- trading - it might actually happen on chain, not just a replay / mock
- concept - you might be building a town, different building types etc.
- the towns might be merged / raided or something like that

## 02 - Upgrade loop

_Core purpose_ - token burn & yield modifiers

Again area open to a lot of change. A lot could be learned from examples in the world, at how people deal with randomization, items, rarity, item effects etc. 


## 03 - Dungeon loop

_Core purpose_ - lock your tokens to obtian more after they unlock - tihs is the outflux from our ponzi

Dungeons are pretty straightforward, its a token lock, that might or might not happen on chain or via contract.
They are open for interpretation as they can grow into something like "multiplayer / collab" type of thing in which we would see multiple people joining up.
